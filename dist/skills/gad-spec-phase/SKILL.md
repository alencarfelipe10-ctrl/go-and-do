<objective>
Clarify phase requirements through structured Socratic questioning with quantitative ambiguity scoring.

**Position in workflow:** `spec-phase → discuss-phase → plan-phase → execute-phase → verify`

**How it works:**
1. Load phase context (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md)
2. Scout the codebase — understand current state before asking questions
3. Run Socratic interview loop (up to 6 rounds, rotating perspectives)
4. Score ambiguity across 4 weighted dimensions after each round
5. Gate: ambiguity ≤ 0.20 AND all dimensions meet minimums → write SPEC.md
6. Commit SPEC.md — discuss-phase picks it up automatically on next run

**Output:** `{phase_dir}/{padded_phase}-SPEC.md` — falsifiable requirements that lock "what/why" before discuss-phase handles "how"
</objective>

<runtime_note>
**Copilot (VS Code):** Use `vscode_askquestions` wherever this workflow calls `AskUserQuestion`. They are equivalent.
</runtime_note>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

**Flags:**
- `--auto` — Skip interactive questions; Claude selects recommended defaults and writes SPEC.md
- `--text` — Use plain-text numbered lists instead of TUI menus (required for `/rc` remote sessions)

Context files are resolved in-workflow using `init phase-op`.
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.

Read the workflow file first — it contains the complete step-by-step process (Socratic interview loop, ambiguity scoring gate, SPEC.md generation). The objective above is a summary; the workflow is the source of truth.
