<objective>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned plans.

`--context` runs an orthogonal check: the running session's context utilization. The workflow asks for the model's tokensUsed + contextWindow, calls `gad-tools query validate.context`, and renders one of three states:

| Utilization | State    | Action                                                |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| < 60%       | healthy  | no action — context is comfortable                    |
| 60% – 70%   | warning  | recommend `/gad-thread` to start fresh                |
| ≥ 70%       | critical | reasoning quality may degrade past the fracture point |
</objective>

<execution_context>
To load this command's workflow spec: check for `.claude/gad-core/workflows/health.md` relative to the current working directory first (project-local); if it is not there, fall back to `~/.claude/gad-core/workflows/health.md` (the global install). If neither file exists, stop — a workflow spec is required and none was found.
</execution_context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Parse `--repair` and `--context` flags from arguments and pass to workflow.
</process>
